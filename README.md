This project focuses on analyzing sentiments expressed in Twitter posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on their textual content.

The workflow includes data collection, text preprocessing (such as removing noise, tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization), and feature extraction to convert text into numerical form. A machine learning model is then trained and evaluated to accurately predict sentiment, helping in understanding public opinion and social trends.

This project demonstrates practical applications of NLP, text classification, and model evaluation, and can be extended to real-time Twitter data analysis.
